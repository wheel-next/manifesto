Our effort to refine and make our philosophy transparent allows us to establish a shared understanding of the reasoning behind our suggestions. This process then helps framing discussion, collaboration and establishing expectations on why some ideas adhere to our \"design axioms\" while others might not. It is not about enforcing a framework but rather about ensuring we stay principled, consistent, and thoughtful and focused on the objective. </p> <p> We do recognize that no set of values is perfect or effective in every situation. We absolutely do welcome disagreements with our \"design axioms\" and encourage dialogue. We want to know if an idea is flawed or is no longer relevant.
